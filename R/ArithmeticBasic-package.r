#' ArithmeticBasic: Taking the square value of the input
#' I used the simple function of just squaring the input.
#' I could have considered polynomials, rational numbers, quadratic equations etc.
#' but that would have increased the complexity of the package which I did not
#' want as this is my first R package with First programming language and
#' I am not very good at this stuff but I am learning.
