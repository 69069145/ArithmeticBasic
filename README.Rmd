This is readme for home work 8. The package which I created is **ArithmeticBasic**. I tried building a new package from scratch. This package has one function **square_vect** which gives the square value of the input. More functions can be added to perform more arithmetic functions. This package can be used through the steps given below.

### Import devtools

``` {r}
library(devtools)
```

### Installing package

``` {r}
install_github("69069145/ArithmeticBasic")
library(ArithmeticBasic)
```

Now having installed and loaded this package we can use the functions inside the package

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```
